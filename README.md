## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

As long as the reader has an Anaconda distibution of Python version 3.*  then there should be no libraries required to run the code in this repo.

## Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project I was interestested in using the  Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey data to investigate

1. What degree major is most common amongst professional developers?
2. Are those with higher job satisfaction typically those with higher salaries?
3. Which company types are most likely to offer full-time remote work?

## Files <a name="files"></a>

This repoi contains two files containing the Stack Overflow data, split as follows:

- The schema, containig all of the questions asked, is survey-data-schema.csv
- The responses of all participants is survey-data-public.csv

There is also a Jupyter Notebook which covers all of the analysis performed on the data.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@jake.wernham/forging-a-career-as-a-developer-827dc3f79371).

## Acknowledgements<a name="acknowledgements"></a>
